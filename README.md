# Program-6
# Purpose: Take a file of Air Force pilots and select the qualified candidates based on their standing height, sitting height, and age.
 
# Input: Take in a file called AFSelection.txt that has the Air Force pilot data. Put that data into parallel arrays, of standing height, sitting height, and age.

# Processing: Take in data from AFSelection.txt and put into arrays. Print out the data. Then convert the standing and siiting heights from centimeters to inches. Display the new data. Find and display the average standing height, sitting height, and age. Finally, find and display the qualified candidates. The qualifiers are: standing height between 64 and 77 inches, sitting height between 34 and 40 inches, and age between  28 and 33 years old.

# Output: Display the original data, the data after centimeters are converted to inches, the averages of each array, and the qualified candidates' data.
